### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am an AI Engineer specializing in Agentic AI applications, Generative AI, and cloud-native ML solutions. I enjoy building systems that combine intelligent interaction, scalability, and real-world impact.

Over the past few years, I have:

Designed Agentic AI workflows with LangGraph and LangChain for financial planning assistants.
Built RAG-based chatbots for contextual, conversational AI.
Developed speech and audio pipelines for voice-enabled applications.
Implemented real-time data pipelines and ML deployments on AWS (Lambda, S3, DynamoDB, QuickSight).
Worked with LLMs, Hugging Face, and CrewAI to optimize domain-specific models and multi-agent collaboration.

Currently, Iâ€™m exploring Reinforcement Learning in healthcare and pursuing deep research in AI and Artificial Superintelligence (ASI). 
My vision is to create human-aligned, scalable AI systems that push the boundaries of intelligent automation.
